**Description :spiral_notepad:  :** 

:wave:  Hey guys, I've always wanted to easily test blips in Fivem without having to restart the script every time and change one value. Today, I'm giving you the FREE solution to this problem !

**Usage :hammer_and_wrench: :**

To use the resource, download it, put the `mth-blips` folder in your main resources folder.
Add `start mth-blips` to your server.cfg
Then, once you're in game, use the command /blips to toggle the menu.

**Features :sparkles: :**
* You can change the blip color and scale in the settings
* STANDALONE : this means that you don't need any dependencies to start this script on your server
* Easy to use


*Demo :eyes:  :*
